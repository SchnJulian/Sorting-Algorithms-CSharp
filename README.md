# Sorting-Algorithms-CSharp
Implementation of sorting algorithms in c# supporting every numeric data type. You can either include the source-code in your own project, or import the .dll file as reference.

## Algorithms

* MergeSort
* IntroSort
* QuickSort
* HeapSort
* BubbleSort
* SelectionSort

## Supported data types

* sbyte
* byte
* short
* ushort
* int
* uint
* long
* ulong
* double
* float
* decimal

Every algorithm takes the unsorted array as parameter and returns the sorted array.
Every function is overloaded for very data type, thus you don't have to worry about different names when calling the functions with arrays of different types.


## How to use
Just add the Sort.cs file to your project folder and use the implemented algorithms via Sort.XX
